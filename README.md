## Overview
This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based BERT for text generation and classification tasks. It utilizes pretrained BERT models for text encoding and decoding. The corresponding paper is available at [Researchgate: Bengali Intent Classification with Generative Adversarial BERT](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/378530127_Bengali_Intent_Classification_with_Generative_Adversarial_BERT).
