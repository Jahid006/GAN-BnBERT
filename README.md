## Overview
This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based approach, named [GAN-BERT(link)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/378530127_Bengali_Intent_Classification_with_Generative_Adversarial_BERT), for text generation and classification tasks. It utilizes pretrained BERT models for text encoding and decoding.
